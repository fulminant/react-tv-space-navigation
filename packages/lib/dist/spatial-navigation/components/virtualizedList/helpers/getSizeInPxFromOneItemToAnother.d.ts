/**
 * This function is used to compute the size in pixels of a range of items in a list.
 * If you want the size taken by items from index 0 to 5, you can call this function with
 * start = 0 and end = 5. The size is computed by summing the size of each item in the range.
 * @param data The list of items
 * @param itemSizeInPx The size of an item in pixels. It can be a number or a function that takes an item and returns a number.
 * @param start The start index of the range
 * @param end The end index of the range
 * @returns The size in pixels of the range of items
